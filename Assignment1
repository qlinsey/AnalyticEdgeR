AN ANALYTICAL DETECTIVE
Problem 2.3 - Understanding Dates in R
#In which month did the fewest motor vehicle thefts occur?
mvt$Month = months(DateConvert)
mvt$Weekday = weekdays(DateConvert)
mvt$Date = DateConvert
which.min(table(mvt$Month))

Problem 2.4 - Understanding Dates in R 
#On which weekday did the most motor vehicle thefts occur?
which.max(table(mvt$Weekday))

Problem 2.5 - Understanding Dates in R 
#Which month has the largest number of motor vehicle thefts for which an arrest was made?
which.max(table(mvt$Arrest=="TRUE",mvt$Month)[2,])

Problem 3.1 - Visualizing Crime Trends
hist(mvt$Date, breaks=100)
